# Off-by-One Error in Java Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array. The code attempts to sum the elements of an array, but due to an incorrect loop condition, it tries to access an index that is out of bounds, causing an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code. The `BugSolution.java` file provides the corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of careful array index management in programming.
